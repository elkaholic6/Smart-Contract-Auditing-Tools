# Smart-Contract-Auditing-Tools

Here are the tools/scripts I made to use when auditing smart contracts.

| Script/Tool Name | Description | Link |
|------------------|-------------|------|
| Slither script for single contract         | Javascript script that runs Slither on any codebase, filters for specific contracts within the codebase, and outputs results to text files. | [Slither Analysis repo](https://github.com/elkaholic6/Slither-script-for-single-solidity-contract) |
| Constructor analysis          | Scans constructor of solidity smart contract for checks to zero address  | [Constructor Repo](https://github.com/elkaholic6/Solidity-constructor-analysis)   |
